<h1>Contribute to the ORBIT research dataset!</h1>
<p>Smartphones have proven to be a very useful tool for blind and low vision users to access visual material in their everyday activities, from finding the right office door to getting their shopping done. The development of Artificial Intelligence, or AI, plays an important role in this. Seeing AI, for example, uses AI to describe pictures taken with the phone camera. While these kinds of AI systems currently recognise common items, such as a mug, they can’t say whether it’s your mug or someone else’s. They also might not recognize items important to blind or low vision people, such as a white cane. The ORBIT team, City University, in partnership with Microsoft Research, are trying to change this by building new algorithms that can do personalized object recognition. To achieve this goal, we need your help. We need a set of videos of things that are important to you. You can find more about the project at our website: <a href="http://orbit.city.ac.uk">http://orbit.city.ac.uk</a>.</p>
<p>To get involved, you must be:</p>
<ul>
<li>18 years or older</li>
<li>Live in the United Kingdom</li>
<li>registered blind (or equivalent)</li>
<li>Speak English fluently</li>
<li>Have an iPhone</li>
<li>Do not have a cognitive impairment that could prevent giving informed consent</li>
</ul>
<p>Your participation would involve:</p>
<ul>
<li>Filling in a background survey</li>
<li>Using an iPhone app to take 8 videos each of 10 things that you might want your phone to recognise</li>
<li>You’ll get a £50 Amazon voucher in appreciation of your time.</li>
</ul>
